# ChatRun 

This Roblox Lua script adds a `/run` command onto the chat, regardless of the chat version. (Uses an [ExtraAbilities](<https://github.com/IvanTheProtogen/ExtraAbilities>) module!)

Recommended to put this script on auto-execute.

# Commands 

```
/run <code> -- Executes the provided code.
/auth <player_name> -- Authorizes or unauthorizes the player to use /run on your client.
```
