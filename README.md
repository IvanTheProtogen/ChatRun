# ChatRun (REMAKE)

This Roblox Lua script allows you to execute code via the chat, regardless of the chat version. (Uses an [ExtraAbilities](<https://github.com/IvanTheProtogen/ExtraAbilities>) module!)

Recommended to put this script on auto-execute.

# How to use 

Just say `$ <<CODE>>` in the chat to execute code.
